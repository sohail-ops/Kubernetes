To deploy/apply multiple yaml files at once.

Create kustomization.yaml file in which only resources has to define that are to depolyed

resources:
  - namespace.yaml
  - mongo-config.yaml
  - mongo-secret.yaml
  - mongo.yaml
  - webapp.yaml

Once this yaml is created from your directory use the following command
if on the same directory
kubectl apply -k .

if on the another directory
kubectl apply -k ./yaml-dir/

This will deploy all mentioned files in kustomization.yaml without needed to run every single yaml
